        <p> Leonardo MkLeoLópez is widely considered to be the best Smash player alive today, having won countless major tournaments with multiple fighters over Ultimate.
            However, the Mexican Smash icon may be absent for some upcoming events, including the long-awaited Ludwig Invitational later this month, 
            after revealing his health conditions have taken a turn for the worst.
          Unfortunately, this means that Leo will be missing Battle of Z in Montreal and may also not be able to attend Ludwig’s Smash Invitational, either.

The Ludwig Invitational is one of the most stacked events in Smash history, featuring many of the world’s best players from Japan, North America, and Europe in a massive 32-player tournament that will also see the return of FaZe Sparg0.

            <p> MkLeo was one of the most skilled playes in Wii U. He was ranked 1st on the PGR v5, which was the first time a player other than ZeRo was considered the best player in the world. After the release of Ultimate, he was ranked 1st in the Spring 2019 PGRU, maintaining his top ranking between games.

MkLeo was signed by Echo Fox on January 4, 2017.[1] The team disbanded on November 8, 2019.[2]

One of his best performances in Ultimate was at EVO 2019, the largest Smash tournament of all time, where he made a monstrous losers run to win the tournament. After losing to Kameme's Mega Man in winners round 1 of top 32, Leo went on to beat Maister, ScAtt, Abadango, Zackray, Raito, Samsora, Glutonny, and Tweek (x2) on his path to first place.

MkLeo reached the grand finals of 37 consecutive offline Ultimate tournaments, starting with his 1st place finish at MomoCon 2019 in May 2019 and ending at Smash Ultimate Summit 4 in March 2022, where he placed 4th after being eliminated by ProtoBanham.

He joined T1 on February 26, 2020.[3] He parted ways with T1 February 23, 2023.[4]

                <p> MkLeo, also known simply as Leo, is a smasher from Mexico. He is widely considered to be the best Super Smash Bros. Ultimate player in the world, dominating the competitive scene since the game's release. He is currently ranked 1st on the Mexican Ultimate Power Rankings, OrionRank 2022, and UltRank 2022. Originally playing Ike, he later found tournament success with Lucina and Wolf before picking up Joker shortly after the character's release. Although he briefly struggled during the online metagame, he eventually found consistent success after picking up Byleth, as well as Pyra and Mythra following their release, leading him to be ranked 5th on the Wi-Fi Warrior Rank v7. He has continued to use Byleth offline and achieve major success in tournaments.

In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, MkLeo played Marth and Cloud, with Bayonetta, Meta Knight, Lucina, and Corrin as strong secondaries. He is his country's best player and was considered to be the best player in the world in 2018 after ZeRo's retirement. He is also widely considered the best Marth and Cloud player in the world, one of the two best Lucina players in the world (along with Mr E), one of the best Bayonetta players in the world, and formerly considered one of the best Corrin players and the best Meta Knight player prior to dropping both characters. Leo arguably popularized both Meta Knight and Marth, characters that had been seen as mediocre after their nerfs from Brawl, as top players such as Abadango have since used Meta Knight against other top players until his nerfs in game updates, as well as lower-leveled players picking up Marth due to his dominance with him. He is the youngest player to win a major Smash 4 tournament, doing so at only 15 years old, achieving this feat at 2GGT: ZeRo Saga. Due to his aggressive style and heavy punish game with Meta Knight and proving his skills surpass those of top players at a very young age, some compare him to Nairo's early Brawl career.
